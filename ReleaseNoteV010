------- version 25 Feb. 2018 ------- by H. Akai
Major revise:
Dynamical allocation of memory is introduced and the program
is now indepent to the size of the system to be calculated.
Accordingly the code must be compiled by Fortran 90 compiler.
It is not necessary anumore to modified the parameter statemets
depending on the system size.

Some additional feature:
In addition to fcc, bcc, etc., it is possible to specify
"aux" or "prv". If either one of them is specified system
recognize that 3 primitive unit vector followed by lattice
constant will be given, such as

  aux  -0.5 0.5 0.5  0.5 -0.5 0.5  0.5 0.5 -0.5  5.27

for bcc with the lattice constant a=5.27 (a.u.)
In this case c/a, b/a, alpha, beta, and gamma should be
omitted.

Also, it is now possible to tilet the crystal axis. It is
done by using "tlt" keyword attached after bravai type
or "aux" ("prv"), like

  fcctlt  0 90 0  6.65

or

  auxtlt  -0.5 0.5 0.5  0.5 -0.5 0.5  0.5 0.5 -0.5 0 90 0  5.27

In both cases crystal is tilted by Euler angle (0, 90, 0).

------- version 26 Feb. 2017 ------- by H. Akai
'etaopt' is modified to avoid trouble that may occur for
systms with very large lattice constants or in the calculation of
the state with very high energy, say > 40 eV.
'genrpt' and 'gengpt' are slightly modifies
.
------- version 22 Feb, 2017 ------- by H. Akai
Rather minor changes have been made.
subroutine 'sbrnch' is slightly modified to incerese stability.
A new subroutine 'radals' is introduced to increase the accuracy
of the calculation of rafial wavefunctions in ithe semi-relativistic
case.
------- version 7 Aug. 2015 -------- by H. Akai
This version support openMP for both ifort and gfortran. In order to
avoid the stack size problem occuring in gfortran when arraies larger
than 2**16 are used as private in a parallelized region, dynamical
allocations are used in the parallel regions. This is not necessary
for ifort, but ths method seems not a drawback for ifort.
In this version it is not necessary to specify to se the environmet
variable KMP_STACKSIZE. However, number of threads has to be
specified (otherwise it may runs only using a single thread, depending
on the system).

Another new feature provided by this version is the  "spc" program that
plots a dispersion irelation (or broadened dispersion/Bloch spectrum
function for alloy cases) if gnuplot is installed. If "spc" is specified
instead of "go", then the program create data/file_up.spc and
data/file_dn.spc, where data/file is the file specified as a
data file in the input. Using the command

> spc data/file_up.spc

will plot the dispersion on a gnuplot window. In the input data
some additonal data specifying the symmetry points are needed
in addition to the number of k-points that will be plotted.
For example, input data like

spc data/nife
fcc 6.65 , , , , , ,   
0.001 1.0 nrl mjw mag 2nd 
update 4 50 0.03
1   
NiFe 2 1 0.0 2 26 40  
               28 60  
1   
0 0 0 NiFe
c------- below needed only for "spc" cases
c---number of k-point used for the plot
300
c--- W-point
1 0.5 0
c--- L-point
0.5 0.5 0.5
c---  Gamma-point
0 0 0
c--- X-point
1 0 0
c--- W-point
1 0.5 0
c--- K-point
0.75 0.75 0

will will areate data/nife_up.spc and data/nife_dn.spc.
Then

> spc data/nife_up.spc
> spc data/nife_dn.spc
plot the broadend dispersion curves for spin up and down
states of Ni40Fe60 disorderd alloy allong the W-L-Gamma-X-W-K
symmetry lines using 300 k-points. To create the "spc" command,
just type

> make spc

This is a similar procedure to obtain "gdp" command that plot
the DOS curve on a gnuplot window using "make gdp".

Other bugs such as related to the symmetry procedure,
in particular for the case of the spin-orbit coupling
included, have been fixed.

------- version 30 Sep. 2014 -------- by H. Akai
In this version calculation with the spin-orbit coupling becomes
possible. Even the old version can treat the spin-orbit coupling
(not supported) but the results were not correct when the inversion
symmtery is missinb. In order to switch-on the spin-orbit coupling
use "srals" or "lssra" for the relativistic option. "nrlls" or
"lsnrl" also works but it sounds a bit strange.

In the former version, OpenMP failed when "srals' option is
specified, but in this version OpenMP works perfectly. Do not
forget to set KMP_STACKSIZE and OMP_NUM_THREADS when using
OpenMP.

The sample of input and output are seen in the directory "sample".
The shell script "vchk" may be used to run all those sample inputs
and to compare the results with sample ourputs

In order to complie and and excecution file "specx", just type
"make". The makefile is adapted to the intel compiler but you
may easily change the compiler and option by editting couple
of line in the makefile.

Revised subroutines
   specx.f
   spmain.f
   spckkr.f
   bzmesh.f
   kkrsed.f
   brvsym.f
   atmrot.f
   kkrsed.f
   bzmrot.f
   gmtrns.f

New subroutine
   srtrns.f


-------- old release information -----------------
The following routine is replaced.
   prmvec.f
In addition plot routines that may be used for DOS
plot are added. Those routines are compiled by the
make command with parameter 'gpd' as
> make gpd
If the DOS output has been stored in a file,
the dos curve can be plotted by a command
>gpd 'name of the file'
SInce the routine uses gnuplot, the gnuplot system must
has been installed in advance.

Release note for cpa2002v009c (J. Akai, Osaka, 23 Dec. 2007)

Revised routines
   spmain
   bzmesh
   bzmrot
   etaopt

New routines
   setari
   setarc

--------------------------
The main modification from the previous version (cpa2002v008)
are the followings:

1) In order to generate better optimized BZ mesh in the case
   of tetragonal or orthorhombic structure with c/a and b/a
   much different from 1, now the number of devision along
   a, b, and c axes are determined independently. Also the
   size of work area is greately reduced.

2) The parameter "zero" in the "etaopt" is now set to be 1d-11.

3) bzmrot is modified such that it gives correct rotation even
   in the case where the spin-orbit coupling is included.

4) Corresponding to the above modification, the calling
   routines "spmain" is also modified.

5) New routines setari and setarc are included though they are
   not used at the moment. These routines are the integer
   and complex verion of setarr and may be used for debugging.
   
6) Other unimportant modifications have been made.
